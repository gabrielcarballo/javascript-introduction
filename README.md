# JavaScript Introduction Project - Week 2

This project is a reflection of my second week at Trybe Web Development Bootcamp. It's a series of JavaScript functions that I've implemented to solve pre-determined problems.

## Project Overview

The project contains two JavaScript files, `challenges.js` and `challenges2.js`, each containing a series of functions that I've implemented. These functions solve a variety of problems, from simple tasks like calculating the area of a triangle, to more complex tasks like encoding and decoding a string.

## Project Requirements

1. Implement a function using the `&&` operator.
2. Create a function that calculates the area of a triangle.
3. Implement a function that splits a sentence into words.
4. Create a function that concatenates strings.
5. Implement a function that calculates the points in a football championship.
6. Create a function that calculates the number of repetitions of the highest number in an array.
7. Implement a function that determines which cat is closer to a mouse.
8. Create a FizzBuzz function.
9. Implement a function that encodes and decodes a string.
10. Create a function that generates a list of technologies.

## Bonus Requirements

1. Implement a function that generates a phone number from an array of 11 numbers.
2. Create a function that checks if a triangle can be formed with three given lines.
3. Implement a function that suggests how many glasses of water you should drink.

## Testing

All project requirements will be automatically tested using Jest.
